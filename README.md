# qbane's Svelte Template

Personal project template powered by Svelte+Î±.

* Heavily inspired by [the official template of Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
* Production build is handled with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
* Development experience is enhanced with [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), **dev server & HMR included**.

Quick scaffolding command:

```
npx degit qbane/svelte-template svelte-app
```

Tested manually with **Node 12**.
